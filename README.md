# MidnightBot

MidnightSky is a competitive minecraft "skyblock" server.  
This is a discord bot that interacts with their API to return useful information to players.

At one point I refactored the codebase and did not commit throughout. This was a mistake that I have learned from and now I commit often and with detailed messages.
